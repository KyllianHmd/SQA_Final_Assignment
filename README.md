## Project description

The goal of this project is to create a software component for storing survey and response information. Each survey is composed of several questions (up to a maximum of 10). Each SurveyResponse must contain an answer to each question in its survey, where the answer will be an integer value between 1 and 5 (i.e. representing a Likert scale).

# Sprint backlog and task estimation

As a reminder, the sprint backlog is the set of user stories from the product backlog that the team commits to deliver by the end of the sprint (user stories are put in the sprint backlog according to their business value and technical complexity). Thus, the most important work will be done first.
